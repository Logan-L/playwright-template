# Playwright Template
The ```playwright-template``` project provides a baseline for the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) Web Testing and Automation framework. In addition to Playwright, the [JUnit](https://junit.org/) testing framework has been included and configured to run tests in parallel.

## Running Tests
To run all tests in the project, execute the following command.
